Saliency API, Where to Focus in a Scene
=======================================

The purpose of this module is to create, group and make available to the users, different saliency algorithms, belonging to different categories. Saliency API -- Where humans would look in a scene. Has routines for static, motion and "objectness" saliency.

0. The EdgeBoxes algorithm (Dollar et al, 2014) utilizes edge information in an image to propose a set of bounding boxes which enclose objects. The algorithm searches for windows with fully-enclosed edge-groups, and penalizes windows with edge-groups which cross the boundary of the box.
0. This is an initial implementation in OpenCV

Usage
------

Using the EdgeBoxes algorithm requires providing an image and selecting an edge-finding algorithm, or providing an edge-only image. The class will return a list of boxes (defined by four points of a Vec4i), and their associated "objectness". Objectness is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being the highest score. Please see the syntax below:

```c++

Mat edgeImage;
edgeImage = imread("C:/edge_circle.png", 0);
edgeImage.convertTo(edgeImage, CV_64F,1/255.0f);

ObjectnessEdgeBoxes oeb;
std::vector<Vec4i> boxList;
std::vector<double> scoreList;
oeb.getBoxScores(edgeImage, orientationImage, boxList, scoreList);


```

Test Cases
----------

You can run a test case by building saliency/EdgeBoxes/EdgeBoxes.cpp

An example of the object proposals is shown below:
