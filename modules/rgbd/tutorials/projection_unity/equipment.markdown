========

Camera
--------

The plane mapping tutorial can be done without any camera. However, a webcam will help you aligning textures on the surfaces.

For the 3D projection mapping tutorial, a Kinect (or depth sensors supported by OpenNI2) is required.

Projector  
--------

Of course, you need a projector for projection mapping.

Projection target  
--------

A good example is something with a smooth surface (e.g., mannequin):

A bad example is something with a sophisticated surface (e.g., stickman):

Venue
--------

A dim-light room or outside at night is preferable. If you cannot control the room lighting, you may need to make a shade around the projection target.
