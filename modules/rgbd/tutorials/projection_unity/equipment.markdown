Equipment {#tutorial_projection_unity_equipment}
========

You can start the projection mapping tutorial only with a computer, a projector, and something to be projected onto. However, if you have a webcam and/or a Kinect, you can try more complicated examples.

Camera
--------

The plane mapping tutorial can be done without any camera. However, a webcam will help you aligning textures on the surfaces.

For the 3D projection mapping tutorial, a Kinect (or depth sensors supported by OpenNI2) is required.

Projector
--------

Of course, you need a projector for projection mapping.

Projection target
--------

A good example is something with a smooth surface (e.g., mannequin):

A bad example is something with a sophisticated surface (e.g., stickman):

Environment
--------

A dim-light room or outside at night is preferable not only for the appearance but also for object scanning. If you don't have a control of the room lighting, you may need to make a shade around the projection target.
