========

Projection mapping is a technique to augment a scene using a projector ([link](http://www.creativebloq.com/video/projection-mapping-912849)). Classic techniques require 3D modeling and tedious video alignment, but in our tutorials, we use the power of OpenCV and Unity3D to make these steps easier!

Here are the 4 main steps for projection mapping:

1. Prepare graphics to map (download from internet, or draw it by yourself!).

2. Project "structured light" to scan the object.

3. Generate a 3D mesh of the object.

4. Open Unity3D to align the image, and enjoy projection mapping!
