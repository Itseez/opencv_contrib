5. Keep the window floating all the time; this helps when the game window accidentally went fullscreen on the primary display.

6. Fill *Monitor Width* (width of your monitor in pixels), *Projector Width* and *Projector Height* (projector resolution).

7. When you're done, press *Go Fullscreen*. You can check/uncheck it whenever you want, regardless of the game is playing or not.
