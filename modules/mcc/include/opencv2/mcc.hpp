Introduction
------------

ColorCharts are a tool for calibrating the color profile of camera, which not
only depends on the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of camera but also on the
lighting conditions. This is done by taking the image of a chart, such that the
value of its colors present in it known, in the image the color values changes
depeding on many variables, this gives us the colors initially present and the
colors that are present in the image, based on this information we can apply any
suitable algorithm to find the actual color of all the objects present in the
image.
