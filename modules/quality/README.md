Quality API, Image Quality Analysis
=======================================

The purpose of this module is to create, group and make different image quality algorithms available to the users

- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
- Structural similarity (SSIM)
- Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD)
